                New products and model lines were introduced to the brand's portfolio and brought to the market and saw
                an increased productivity for the brand. In the late 2000s, during the worldwide financial crisis and
                the subsequent economic crisis, Lamborghini's sales saw a drop of nearly 50 per cent.Manufacturing
                magnate Italian Ferruccio Lamborghini founded the company in 1963 with the objective of producing a
                refined grand touring car to compete with offerings from established marques such as Ferrari. The
                company's first models, such as the 350 GT, were released in the mid-1960s. Lamborghini was noted for
                the 1966 Miura sports coupé, which used a rear mid-engine, rear-wheel drive layout.

                            Vehicle insurance (also known as car insurance, motor insurance, or auto insurance) is
                            insurance for cars,
                            trucks, motorcycles, and other road vehicles. Its primary use is to provide financial
                            protection against
                            physical damage or bodily injury resulting from traffic collisions and against liability
                            that could also
                            arise from incidents in a vehicle. Vehicle insurance may additionally offer financial
                            protection against
                            theft of the vehicle, and against damage to the vehicle sustained from events other than
                            traffic collisions,
                            such as keying, weather or natural disasters, and damage sustained by colliding with
                            stationary objects. The
                            specific terms of vehicle insurance vary with legal regulations in each region.
